00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Subtitles provide text alternatives for spoken dialogue.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000

Subtitles benefit users who need translation support.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They also help in situations where audio quality is poor.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Proper timing and synchronization are essential for accessibility.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
