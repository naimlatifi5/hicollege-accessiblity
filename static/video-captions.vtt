This video demonstrates accessibility features in multimedia content.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Captions provide text alternatives for audio content.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They include dialogue, sound effects, and music descriptions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000

Captions benefit deaf and hard-of-hearing users.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Music fades out]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
